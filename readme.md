# Javascript Algorithms

Here I will add a handful of algorithms from many fields I find useful and interesting.

## Euclidean (aka GCD)

[Preview](Euclidean.js)  
GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor.  
Given 2 natural numbers, find their greatest common divisor that divides both of them without leaving any reminder.

> Time Complexity: O(log min(a, b))

## Graph (Data Structure)

[Preview](Graph.js)  
Will be used in graph algorithms later on.  
Assuming each node is connected to at least one other node.  
Can be direcred/undirecred and/or weighted/unweighted.  
Using adjacency list.  
Default graph is direcred & unweighted (weight = 1).
