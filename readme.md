# Javascript Algorithms

Here I will add a handful of algorithms from many fields I find useful and interesting.

## Euclidean (aka GCD)

[Preview](Euclidean.js)  
GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor.  
Given 2 natural numbers, find their greatest common divisor that divides both of them without leaving any reminder.

> Time Complexity: O(log min(a, b))
